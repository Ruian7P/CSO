- **byte address**
  - small address number: low address
  - big address number : high address
- **byte saving**
  - save from right to left, right side is low byte, left side is high byte
  - eg. 123456, 6 is in low byte, 1 is in high byte
 
- **Save methods**
  - **Big-endian**: save high byte in low memory address
    - eg: for 0x 12 34 56 78, save it as 12 34 56 78
  - **Little-endian**: save low byte in low memory address
    - eg: for 0x 12 34 56 78, save it as 78 56 34 12
    - Most computer use Little-endian
